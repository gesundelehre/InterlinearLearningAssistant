Create Interlinear Texts for easier Language Learning

Goals
* Software can be used offline
* Google Translation can be added later on, after the text has been imported
* List of words with corresponding translation can be exported
* For already existing texts with translations, the wordtranslations thereof can be edited
* project (texts + translations) can be deleted
* projects are saved into the corresponding folders sorted by language-of-origin/language-of-destination
* interlineartext can be exported as pdf
* html-website can be created to read the interlinear text and listen to the audio
* audio for interlinear text can be recored
* pre-recorded audio (already existing mp3) for interlinear text can be uploaded
* words are saved separately (word - translation)
* for one word, multiple translations can be saved (word - translation 1 / translation 2 / translation 3)
* there is a raw mode & finetuning mode (for annotations)
* paragraphs are displayed correctly in HTML and PDF
* titles can be displayed in HTML and PDF
* it's possible to get an overview over all projects
* words directly imported from google translate and already proofread words are displayed differently
* tsv-file can be adapted manually & afterwards the html and pdf file can be created afresh (resp. it can be updated)
* other alphabets can be handled than the roman
* additional line for romanization can be added (for easier reading of foreign alphabets)
* an interlinear text can be exported along with its audio into a bundle that can be used apart from the PHP software offline

Step 1: Only create Interlinear Texts
Step 2: Add the additional possibility to create Parallel Texts
