Create Interlinear Texts for easier Language Learning

Goals
* Software can be used offline
* Google Translation can be added later on, after the text has been imported
* For already existing texts with translations, the wordtranslations thereof can be edited

* words are saved separately (word - translation)
* for one word, multiple translations can be saved (word - translation 1 / translation 2 / translation 3)
* there is a raw mode & finetuning mode (for annotations)
* words directly imported from google translate and already proofread words are displayed differently
* tsv-file can be adapted manually & afterwards the html and pdf file can be created afresh (resp. it can be updated)






* Step 1: Only create Interlinear Texts
* Step 2: Add the additional possibility to create Parallel Texts
